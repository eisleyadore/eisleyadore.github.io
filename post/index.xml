      <description>The Three Point line was introduced to the NBA in the year 1980. Players and coaches saw it as a gimmick; the average three point attempts per game in 1980 was just 2.77 shots. Lets see how that has changed over time.
ggplot(data = threetwo_year, aes(x = Year, y = THREEPA_avg)) +geom_segment(aes(x = Year, xend = Year, y = 0, yend = THREEPA_avg)) +geom_point(size = 4, color = &amp;quot;#00BFC4&amp;quot;) +theme_bw() +ggtitle(&amp;quot;Average Three Point Attempts per Game, 1980-2019&amp;quot;) +ylab(&amp;quot;Three Point Attempts&amp;quot;)We can see an obvious increase in the number of three point attempts from 1980 to 2019, with just 2.</description>

      <description>I wanted to try out some new plots/ways to visualize data that I have never used before.
The first one was the use of library(gghighlight).
ggplot(allstats, aes(x = Year, y = THREEP., color = Player)) +geom_line(size = 1.25) +gghighlight(mean(THREEP.) &amp;gt; 40, label_key = Player) + #highlight!ylab(&amp;quot;Three Points Percentage&amp;quot;) +ggtitle(&amp;quot;Average Three Point Field Goal Percentage, years 2017-2019&amp;quot;) +geom_point(size = 3.25) +scale_x_continuous(name =&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;, breaks=c(1,2,3)) +theme_bw()This library lets you highlight lines, points, etc.</description>

      <description>I wanted to see if three point percentage affect winning. Let’s try making a simple linear model:
threePointModel &amp;lt;- lm(GW ~THREEPP_100,data = stats_2019)summary(threePointModel)## ## Call:## lm(formula = GW ~ THREEPP_100, data = stats_2019)## ## Residuals:## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -21.7873 -5.8964 0.3398 7.7762 20.0635 ## ## Coefficients:## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&amp;gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) -110.234 44.371 -2.484 0.01923 * ## THREEPP_100 4.</description>

      <title>Getting the Data</title>

      <description>All you need to start data analysis, well after figuring out what you want to study, is to find the data! I wanted to answer the question: “Could Michael Jodan play in today’s NBA?”.
I wanted to look at nba player stats from the years 1996-1998 (the Jordan-dominant years) and from 2017-2019 (today’s NBA). I got the data from nba.com and basketball-reference.com.
I actually ended up, mostly, copying-pasting data into an excel file and stack data from all the years together on top of eachother.</description>

      <title>Data Science In Sports</title>

      <description>Sports analytics is one of the leading fields in data science. Most professional sports teams call on the help from professional statisticians to help with their operations, be it in team/individual performance or in business performance.
“Who do you think will win?”, “Why is this team dominant?”, “Who is the best player right now?”, “What is the best strategy in this situation”. There are several reasons why a team would ask these questions and, through data science, these answers could be studied AND visualised.</description>

      <description>https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/
This post goes over the topic &amp;ldquo;Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetetive?&amp;rdquo;. It uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm which uses compression (reducing the size of a song based on repetive lyrics) to measure repetetion of pop lyrics.
The website shows the steps to the algorithm in a somewhat-interactive way with clear and specific steps aided by visualizations of the algorithm actually compressing lyrics, which is really cool.
The post stated that 2014 was the most repetitive year ever and that songs that reached the top 10 where on average more repetitive than the rest in every year from 1960 to 2015.</description>
